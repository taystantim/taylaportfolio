### Gas Prices

Introduction

Gasoline accounts for almost half of the oil consumption in United States, and it is the
largest single volume refined product sold in the United States(TradingEconomics). Weekly,
monthly, and annual prices of gasoline are calculated by the U.S. Energy Information Ad-
ministration by taking an unweighted average of the daily prices (EIA). The dataset that is
analyzed in this study contains the weekly New York Harbor conventional regular gasoline
spot price in cents per gallon. This dataset includes data from 2000 to mid-2010, and it has
a total of 575 observations. Understanding the trends in gas prices are indicative of how
the energy industry is performing. Furthermore, a random sequence of observations {xt}
that are recorded in a time ordered fashion are time series. The objective of this time series
analysis is to see how what happened today, and in past days, will affect what happens to-
morrow. Furthermore, this time series analysis will propose a statistical model that explains
the relations of adjacent points in the gas prices that are correlated in time.
